# DevOS
By Jack Woo
---

This is the documentation for nearly all of the code that I have written for this OS. You will NOT find any documentation for the assembly files here, but there should be a sufficient amount of comments in the files themselves. 

The standard library is located at `src/kernel/std/std.hpp`, and contains basic functions such as malloc, strlen, etc... 

PULL REQUESTS TO THE <b>[GITHUB](https://github.com/woo200/devos)</b> ARE ACCEPTED AND WELCOME! I would be very happy to have others contribute to this project of mine.
